This work is inspired by the efforts to predict the functionality of non-coding DNA sequences done by Yu Li at the Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong

## CCN Primer

Currently, colvolutional neural networks are the methodological answer to the question of highly correlated data inputs. In the areas of machine vision and all image based learning the ability of CNNs to encode spatial information into machine readable inputs has led to the creation of incredibly accurate models. For more information about how they function and their usage in bioinformatics read the following.

## Project Overview

Data gathered from DeepSEA (deep learningâ€“based sequence analyzer) in the form of 1000-bp DNA sequences which are centered on non-overlapping 200-bp bins.
